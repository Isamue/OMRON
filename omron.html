         <hr>
         <li>Stop using this monitor and consult with your physician if you experienced skin irritation or discomfort.</li>
         <li>Consult with your physician before using this monitor on an arm where intravascular access or therapy, or an arterio-venous (A-V) shunt, is present because of temporary interference to blood flow which could result in injury.</li>
         <li>Consult with your physician before using this monitor if you have had a mastectomy.</li>
         <li>Consult with your physician before using this monitor if you have severe blood flow problems or blood disorders as cuff inflation can cause bruising.</li>
         <li>DO NOT take measurements more often than necessary because bruising, due to blood flow interference, may occur.</li>
         <li>ONLY inflate the arm cuff when it is applied on your upper arm.</li>
