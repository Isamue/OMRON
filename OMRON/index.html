           <h3>2.3 Blood Pressure Measurement Tips</h3>
           To help ensure an accurate reading, follow these directions:
           <li>Stress raises blood pressure, Avoid taking measurements during stressful times.</li>
           <li>Measurements should be taken in a quiet place.</li>
           <li>It is important to take measurements at the same times each day.</li>
           Taking measurements in the evening is recommended.
           <li>Remember to have a record of your blood pressure and pulse readings for your physician. A single measurement does not provide an accurate indication of your true blood pressure. You need to take and record several readings over a period of time.</li>
           <b>‚ö†Ô∏èCaution</b>
           <hr>
           <li><b>Avoid bathing, during alcohol or caffeine, smoking, exercising and eating for at least 30 minutes before taking a measurement.</b></li>
           <li><b>Rest for at least 5 minutes before a measurement.</b></li>
           <hr>
           <h3>2.4 Applying the Arm Cuff</h3>
           <b>Note</b>
           <li>The following steps are for applying the arm cuff to your arm.</li>
           When you take a measurement on your right arm, follow the cuff wrap instructions for a right arm use mentioned under "To take a measurement on your right arm" located at the end of this subsection.
          <li>The blood pressure can difffer between the right arm and the left arm, and the measured blood pressure reading can be different.</li>
          OMRON recommend you to always use the Same arm for measurement. If the readings between both arms differ substantially, check with your physician to determine as to which arm to use for your measurements.
         <br> <b>‚ö†Ô∏èCaution</b>
          <hr>
          <li><b>Remove tight-fitting or thick clothing from your arm while taking a measurement.</b></li>
